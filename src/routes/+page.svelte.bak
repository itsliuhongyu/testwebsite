                    <p>Over the past two months, the<a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/09/wisconsin-voter-guide-2024-us-house-1-2/"> race for the White House</a> between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump has dominated the political conversation — especially in a critical battleground state like Wisconsin. But on Nov. 5 there will be scores of other races on the ballots of Wisconsin voters, including contests for <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/08/wisconsin-voter-guide-2024-us-senate-1/">U.S. Senate</a>, <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/08/wisconsin-voter-guide-2024-us-house-1/">eight U.S. House</a> seats, <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/08/wisconsin-voter-guide-2024-assembly-home/">99 state Assembly seats</a>, <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/08/wisconsin-voter-guide-2024-state-senate-1/">16 state Senate seats</a>, some county offices and even an <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/08/constitutional-amendments/">amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution</a>.</p>
                    <p>The implications of these down-ballot races could be massive. In the Legislature, for example, Democrats have a <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/08/wisconsin-democrat-dnc-kamala-harris-assembly-senate-election-republican/">chance to win a majority in the Assembly</a> for the first time in more than a decade, potentially upending Republicans’ iron grip on the statehouse and jolting state government in a way not seen for years. That’s largely because the <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2023/12/wisconsin-supreme-court-orders-new-legislative-maps-for-2024/">Wisconsin Supreme Court tossed out GOP-skewed legislative districts</a>, leading to the adoption of more politically balanced maps.</p>

                        <p>In western Wisconsin, both state and national <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/10/wisconsin-congress-van-orden-cooke-republican-democrat-us-house/">Democrats are looking to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden</a>, a freshman Republican being challenged by Democrat Rebecca Cooke. Van Orden flipped the seat in 2022, and Democrats are hoping to take it back in their push to retake the U.S. House majority.</p>
                        <p>In the Milwaukee area, Republicans are hoping to help incumbent state Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/09/wisconsin-milwaukee-senate-election-democrat-republican-stroebel-habush-sinykin/">survive a challenge from Democrat Jodi Habush Sinykin</a>. The race is one of a handful of state Senate seats that will set the field for races in 2026, in which Democrats will look to also flip control of the state Senate.</p>
                        <p>And those are just a few examples. Elections consequential to the daily lives of Wisconsin residents across the state are on the ballot.</p>

                        <p>To register to vote in Wisconsin, you must meet the following <a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/clerk/elections-voting/voter-registration/eligibility-to-vote">requirements</a>:</p>
                        <ul class="wp-block-list">

                            <li>Have resided at your current address for at least 28 days before Election Day.</li>
                            <li>If you’ve been convicted of a felony, you must have completed your sentence, including probation, parole or extended supervision.</li>
                            <li>Have not been adjudicated incompetent to vote by a judge.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><strong>How do you check if you’re registered?</strong></h2>
                        <p>You can check your registration status on the MyVote Wisconsin website <a href="https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Register-To-Vote">here</a> by entering your name and date of birth.</p>
                        <p>The deadline to register <a href="https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Register-To-Vote">online</a> or by mail is Oct. 16. The deadline to register in person at your municipal clerk’s office is Nov. 1 at 5 p.m. If you haven’t registered to vote before Nov. 5, don’t panic. You can register to vote in person at your polling place on Election Day. You’ll just need to bring an <a href="https://myvote.wi.gov/Portals/0/Documents/AcceptablePhotoIDs.pdf?ver=vS9TnMVULlI9Yi0mGe-P0g%3D%3D">accepted form of ID</a> and <a href="https://myvote.wi.gov/Portals/0/Documents/ProofOfResidence.pdf?ver=vS9TnMVULlI9Yi0mGe-P0g%3d%3d">proof of residence</a> (and meet the requirements listed above).</p>

                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><strong>Can I vote by mail?</strong></h2>
                        <p>Yes. Wisconsin voters don’t need a reason to vote by mail/be an absentee voter. Every registered Wisconsin voter has the ability to request an absentee ballot by mail. You can request an absentee ballot on MyVote Wisconsin <a href="https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Vote-Absentee-By-Mail">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>Once you’ve submitted your request for an absentee ballot, you can track your ballot <a href="https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Track-My-Ballot">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>Before you begin filling out your absentee ballot, make sure you have a witness who can verify that you filled out your own ballot. The witness needs to be an adult U.S. citizen who is not a candidate in the upcoming election. Once you’ve completed your ballot, place it in the certified envelope that comes with your absentee ballot. Seal and sign the certificate envelope and then have your witness sign the certificate and include the witness’ address.</p>
                        <p>The next step is to mail it back to your municipal clerk. The United States Postal Service recommends mailing your ballot back at least seven days before Election Day, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.</p>
                        <p>If you’re worried about your ballot being returned in time, you can deliver it to your municipal clerk’s office or deliver it to your polling place on Election Day.</p>

                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><strong>Can I put my absentee ballot in a ballot drop box?</strong></h2>
                        <p>Yes. The Wisconsin Supreme Court recently <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/07/wisconsin-supreme-court-allows-expanded-use-of-ballot-drop-boxes/">ruled</a> that Wisconsin communities can once again use drop boxes to collect absentee ballots. However, the use of drop boxes is not required, so it’s up to your municipal clerk whether they are available in your community or not.</p>
